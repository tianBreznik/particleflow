# Particleflow
A particle system project based on the FBO ping-ponging method with post processing shaders simulating strange attractors distorted with a couple of different noise algorithms.

The project is available for view [_here_](https://tianbreznik.github.io/particleflow/). Please check it out and play around with it! 
Hint: For the most beautiful and dynamic effects try changing the *normalize factor* and *time step* parameters
